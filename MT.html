    <h1>MUAY THAI</h1>
    <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInTopLeft">
      I started Muay Thai at 17, fought all over England, Ireland and Thailand.
      I Ran my own gym for a number of years producing a strong stable of
      professional fighters and a world champion. I loved being "Coach" more
      than i did actually fighting, probably because I was much better at it. 

      I also compete in BJJ and had a couple of MMA Fights, this video below was my MMA debut!
