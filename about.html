    <h1>Jordan Williams</h1>
    <p>
      my names jordan williams, I am 33 and im from Liverpool in the UK. New to
      the world of developing, it’s a far cry away from what I'm used to but I
      have been taken in by the whole thing.<br />
      I have a thirst for knowledge and love expanding my skill set, in all
      aspects of life. <br />
      <br />I have always taken bold choices and opted for experience over
      qualifications, I didn't go to University, traditional learning just was
      not not for me.<br />
      <br />
      I went traveling, found something that took me in, and made it my life. I
      lived as a professional Muay Thai fighter and coach. <br />I gained SO
      much from this including skills in coaching, not just sports but people,
      man-management, and also business running my own gym which included a
      small shop for a period of time. <br />

      <br />
      I am capable of working well autonomously and also confident in taking the
      lead when the need fits the situation.<br />I consider myself to have
      excellent communication and interpersonal skills and able to adapt
      conversations with the general public and people at all levels.
      <br />
      <br />The jobs and roles I have had have not left me with a list of
      qualifications but a wealth of “life-skills” and global experience.<br />I
      look at things differently from a lot of people and like to figure out the
      “different” ways to do things, achieve my goals and solve problems I’m
      faced with. <br />
      <br />
      Moving and handling trained, First Aid & CPR trained,Behaviour management,
      Coaching and mentoring, Physically fit. Blue belt in BJJ. Former Pro
      athlete.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of "work" and developlment, I have lots of hobbies and
      intrests.<br />
      I like to stay active, I go mountain biking, inline skating and walking
      quite often,<br />i enjoy going on walks with my wife and children.<br />
      I love cars, bikes , football(Liverpool fan), gadgets and reading
      books.<br />

      As much as i love music, id much rather take Netflix and a takeaway than a
      night out in Town.<br />
      If you have any questions for me at all, please dont hesitate to ask.
      <br />
      Thank You
